# Using the starter apps
{: #using_starter_applications}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides starter apps called boilerplates, which are templates that include one application, its associated runtime environment, and predefined services for a particular domain. Follow these steps to select a boilerplate and begin working.
{:shortdesc}

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog](https://console.{DomainName}/catalog/),
navigate to the Boilerplates section.
2. Click the boilerplate you want to use.
3. Enter a name for your app, modify the host name if required, and click **Create**. Your app begins staging, and the Getting started tutorial for your app on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard displays.
4. Follow the steps in the tutorial to:  
  * Download the software you need to build your app.
  * Download the sample app.
  * Deploy the sample app.

The directory containing the sample app you downloaded contains a README file. Refer to the README for a description of the files in the sample app package. Make changes to the code, deploy the application again, then see the effect in your running app.
